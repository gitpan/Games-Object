Revision history for Perl extension Games::Object.

0.03  Sat Apr  6 06:42:00 MST 2002
	Completely reworked the event handling mechanism to allow events
	to be targeted for specific objects.

	Events also now trigger as soon as they happen. Queueing them didn't
	really make any sense once I really looked at it.

	The "round" option for -on_fractional now works properly.

	Added events objectLoaded and objectSaved to allow for class-specific
	data manipulation.

	Fixed bug where the persistent mod table was not being initialized
	properly and probably caused perl to complain under -w, though the
	code still worked.

	Altered the default process_list by removing the second call to
	process_queue(), since the changes to the event structure obviates
	the need for this.

	Expanded the priority.t test suite to cover tend-to and persistent mods.

	Added event.t test suite.

	Corrected some erroneous examples in the docs.

	Put the perldoc stuff into a separate file, as it was growing
	as large as the code itself.

	The docs stated that a reference to an object subclassed to
	Games::Object assigned to an attribute of 'any' would save/load
	the reference correctly. Now it really does.

	The docs also stated that GLOB references worked in the -file
	parameter to new(), load(), and save(). Now they really do.

	Added attr_exists() and del_attr().

	attr() and raw_attr() no longer croak with the attribute does not
	exist; they simply return undef instead.

	Added 'readable_filename' as a datatype to FetchParams()

	Added function TotalObjects()

	Added some missing tests to loadsave.t (object references and
	PLACEHOLDER functionality)

0.01  Sun Jan 20 16:33:48 MST 2002
	Initial alpha release. Probably stable, but lacking in some polish
	and some functionality. Reasonably comprehensive docs, though.
