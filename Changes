Revision history for Perl extension Games::Object.

0.02  ???
	The docs stated that a reference to an object subclassed to
	Games::Object assigned to an attribute of 'any' would save/load
	the reference correctly. Now it really does.

	The docs also stated that GLOB references worked in the -file
	parameter to new(), load(), and save(). Now they really do.

	Added attr_exists() and del_attr().

	attr() and raw_attr() no longer croak with the attribute does not
	exist; they simply return undef instead.

	Added 'readable_filename' as a datatype to FetchParams()

	Added function TotalObjects()

	Added some missing tests to loadsave.t (object references and
	PLACEHOLDER functionality)

0.01  Sun Jan 20 16:33:48 MST 2002
	Initial alpha release. Probably stable, but lacking in some polish
	and some functionality. Reasonably comprehensive docs, though.
