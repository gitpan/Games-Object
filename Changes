Revision history for Perl extension Games::Object.

0.05  Mon Nov 25 18:18:17 MST 2002
	Added a feature that allows a more deterministic way of specifying
	processing order of objects with the same priority.

	Fixed a false assumption problem in event.t that caused a test
	failure under Perl 5.8.0.

	Persistent mods can now be made to take effect immediately by adding
	-apply_now => 1 to the mod_attr() call. This indirectly helps
	alleviate the timing issue with process(), enough that I have removed
	it from the BUGS section.

	Persistent mods can now work properly with attributes at OOB conditions.
	This was more a documentation change than a code change, as this
	feature was always present, but was not obvious from the docs.

	Added ability to inherit attribute values via object parenting. Added
	the corresponding inherit.t test suite.

	Made some corrections to examples in the POD docs.

0.04  Sat Jun  8 12:46:16 MDT 2002
	Much of the changes here are to support the upcoming release of the
	Games::TileMap module.

	This module now requires a minimum Perl version of 5.6.0.

	Added ability to assert validity of ID in Find() and fail if not valid.

	Added the Id() function to achieve similar assertion functionality.

	Added the objectDestroyed event, triggered when destroy() is called on
	an object.

	Added attr_ref() to allow attributes to be used in -textvariable
	and -variable options in Perl Tk widgets.

	Fixed bug in load() that caused an annoying but harmless "substr
	outside of string" warning under -w if the save file had undefined
	hash values.

	Documented the attribute flags and added flag ATTR_AUTOCREATE.

0.03  Sat Apr  6 06:42:00 MST 2002
	Completely reworked the event handling mechanism to allow events
	to be targeted for specific objects.

	Events also now trigger as soon as they happen. Queueing them didn't
	really make any sense once I really looked at it.

	The "round" option for -on_fractional now works properly.

	Added events objectLoaded and objectSaved to allow for class-specific
	data manipulation.

	Fixed bug where the persistent mod table was not being initialized
	properly and probably caused perl to complain under -w, though the
	code still worked.

	Altered the default process_list by removing the second call to
	process_queue(), since the changes to the event structure obviates
	the need for this.

	Expanded the priority.t test suite to cover tend-to and persistent mods.

	Added event.t test suite.

	Corrected some erroneous examples in the docs.

	Put the perldoc stuff into a separate file, as it was growing
	as large as the code itself.

0.02  Sun Feb 24 09:43:46 MST 2002
	The docs stated that a reference to an object subclassed to
	Games::Object assigned to an attribute of 'any' would save/load
	the reference correctly. Now it really does.

	The docs also stated that GLOB references worked in the -file
	parameter to new(), load(), and save(). Now they really do.

	Added attr_exists() and del_attr().

	attr() and raw_attr() no longer croak with the attribute does not
	exist; they simply return undef instead.

	Added 'readable_filename' as a datatype to FetchParams()

	Added function TotalObjects()

	Added some missing tests to loadsave.t (object references and
	PLACEHOLDER functionality)

0.01  Sun Jan 20 16:33:48 MST 2002
	Initial alpha release. Probably stable, but lacking in some polish
	and some functionality. Reasonably comprehensive docs, though.
